# ArnoldC FizzBuzz

After stumbling on this gem of a programming language, I could not help but spend some free time recreating the classic fizz buzz. Enjoyed it thoroughly and I hope you all feel the same way when reading it. Check the refrences for some great reading on this wicked language.

## Getting Started

The program should run in any modern ArnoldC compilers. The compiler I chose was called [ArnoldC](https://github.com/lhartikk/ArnoldC) by [lhartikk](https://github.com/lhartikk). This Compiler runs using Java so you will need a Java environment set up.

### Prerequisites

```
Java (if using lhartikk compiler)
```

## Running the program

Follow these steps to run the program

```
Copy the ArnoldC.jar into the project folder [ArnoldC](http://lhartikk.github.io/ArnoldC/)
Open command prompt and navigate to the project folder

Run the following commands

java -jar ArnoldC.jar FizzBuzz.arnoldc
java FizzBuzz

```

## Built With

* [ArnoldC](https://github.com/lhartikk/ArnoldC) - The web framework used
* [Java](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html) - The Java runtime environment
